# Solution:-
N = int(input())
prices = list(map(int, input().split()))

min_price = float('inf')
max_profit = 0

for price in prices:
    if price < min_price:
        min_price = price
    else:
        profit = price - min_price
        if profit > max_profit:
            max_profit = profit

print(max_profit)
